  # This job handles the entire process from checkout to deployment
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Use the latest Ubuntu runner for better compatibility and security
    steps:
      # Check out the repository code to access notebooks and configuration
      # This step uses GitHub's official checkout action to clone the repository
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4  # v4 is the latest version as of this workflow creation

      # This step exports the marimo notebooks to static HTML/WebAssembly and builds the index page
      # It uses the marimushka action which is a specialized tool for marimo notebook deployment
      - name: Export notebooks and build index.html
        uses: jebel-quant/marimushka/actions/export@v0.0.22  # Using a specific version for stability

          notebooks: 'notebooks'       # Directory containing regular notebooks (exported as static HTML files)
          notebooks_wasm: 'notebooks'  # Directory containing notebooks for interactive use
